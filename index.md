![BoonJot Header](images/boonjot-header.png?raw=true)

BoonJot is left-handed comic sans family (I supposed). It’s machine-made family with unique stroke speed, pen shape & drawing direction especially Thai glyphs. I designed & drew each glyph as single stroke before expanded it to get proper weight with [FontForge](http://fontforge.github.io/en-US/) then worked in detail with [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/). Glyph style is up-right italic but unlike many handwriting fonts, BoonJot doesn’t try to connect glyphs together so that maintains its casual look & still somewhat legible on screen at small size. As of version 1.0, BoonJot now has italic pair.

Font feature slideshow can be found [here](slideshow.html) and Hinting preview page is [here](hinting.html). If you have any problem with the fonts, pleases file your issues or reports on [Github](https://github.com/fontuni/boonjot/issues).

Many thanks to [f0nt.com community](http://www.f0nt.com/forum/index.php/topic,22790.0.html) for testing & review.
